AutoTest.Net (http://groups.google.com/group/autotestnet)
This product provides continuous testing for the .Net platform.It contains a 
winforms app and a console app.

Features
	* File tracking: Automatic builds and testruns
	* Assembly tracking: Automatic test runs for built assemblies (if 
	  BuildExecutable is removed from config)
		* You can then build through Visual Studio or something similar while
		  still having your tests run automatically
	* Cross platform support through Mono
	* Supports C# and Visual Basic projects
	* Supported build tools
		* MSBuild.exe
		* Mono's xbuild
	* Supported test runners
		* AutoTest.TestRunner (Built in runner supporting NUNit and XUnit pr today)
		* NUnit (Console runner)
		* XUnit (Console runner)
		* MSpec (Console runner)
		* MSTest
	* Supports notifications through
		* notify-send (Linux)
		* Snarl through it's tcp interface (Windows)
		* Growl (Mac, Windows)
	* Supports configurable ignore files using the .gitignore format
	* Local config files extending the main config
		* The attribute override="merge" will merge with original
		* The attribute override="exclude" will remove it all together

Geting started
To get started using this application edit AutoTest.config to suite your system.
When done start either the winforms app or the console app. In the winforms 
application the little button in the top rightcorner will display some nice to 
know messages now and then. When set up just edita file within the watched folder 
and save it. AutoTest.Net will detect any changes and start builds and run tests.
If you end up in a scenario where it goes in to an endless loop it's probably
detecting changes in a file generated either by build or testrun. If so use the
ignore posibility in the configuration file. To figure out what files are being
generated turn on logging and check the debug.log file.

Build from source
To build the whole thing from source just clone or fork the repository. If you want
to build AutoTest.Net with Microsoft .Net instead fo mono go to the Settings folder.
In there you will find the UppercuT.config and UppercuTx86.config files. Locate this
line (<property name="microsoft.framework" value="mono-3.5" overwrite="false" />) in
both files and switch from mono-3.5 to net-3.5.

When done go in and run build and deploy scripts (biuld.sh/build.bat and 
deploy.sh/deploy.bat depending on whether you are on Windows(bat) or something else(sh)).
After running build and deploy scripts you will find the built binaries under the 
ReleaseBinaries folder.

PS!! For building on mono you need 2.8 or later and it uses Git's core.autocrlf=true
